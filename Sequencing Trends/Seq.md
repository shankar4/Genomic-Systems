Understanding various genomic sequencing and analysis techniques is a challenge, given the use of similar sounding terms. I will attempt to provide summaries here to distinguish them and determine the most viable way forward for mapping genomes to complex disease risk. The initial summaries will reflect Wikipedia articles on these topics. Three methods to be studied here: Genome-wide association study (GWAS), Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), and Exome Sequencing.
