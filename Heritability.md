Notes from general and disease specific (obesity and CVD) papers:

GWAS have led to the id of >1200 loci with genetic variants related  to >165 common human diseases and traits.These studies have uncovered many statistically correlative biological pathways whose functional roles are unknown at present. Only a small proportion of heritability of the traits, as derived from twin, adoption, and family studies,  has been explained from the GWAS studies so far (only in a few, >50%, but in most <10%). Larger GWAS studies with lower MAFs are deemed necessary to find the 'tail end' of these loci set that would explain this missing heritability. Zuk et al. hypothesize that epistasis (gene to gene interactions) might explain the additional heritability seen in population (twin, adoption, and family) studies. There is an implicit assumption (my interpretation; but they mention rate limiting effects - so, same) in their hypothesis that these interactions would occur only when genes are expressed at high levels, thus perhaps leading to competititive inhibition (at the recptor level), interference (due to physical proximity), and consequent missed regulatory effects. Such interactions would not occur when expression levels are lower, avoiding such 'cross-talk' (engineering term). They call this 'phantom' heritability. In math terms, *Ï€<sub>explained</sub> = (h<sup>2</sup><sub>known</sub>)/(h<sup>2</sup><sub>all</sub>*, where LHS is heritability explained, with the RHS numerator representing the additvie effects of phenotypic variance due to the known genetic loci (and variants therein), and the RHS denominator representing the phenotypic variance attributable to the additive effects of all variants, known and unknown. The latter is estimated indirectly from population studies. *
