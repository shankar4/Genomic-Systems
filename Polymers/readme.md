Four major biopolymers are recognized here: Protein, Nucleic Acid, Sachharide, and Water. There is significant interest in the first two at present. I plan to summarize all of them so new methods for mapping genomes to disease can take appropriate systems and dynamic perspectives.

This will be a 'clearing house' page that will link summaries elsewhere on all these four, while including additional information here on heterogenous polymer components.
